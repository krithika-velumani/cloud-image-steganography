To Develop a comprehensive data security system that employs a combination of Hybrid 
Cryptography and steganography techniques to safeguard images, ensuring robust encryption 
and covert data embedding for enhanced confidentiality and integrity in cloud based storage. 
Methodology: 
• The methodology for this project involves a multi-faceted approach to ensure image 
data security in cloud-based storage.  
• The process begins with implementing a distributed attribute-based encryption 
scheme. 
• Hadamard-based techniques, known for their efficacy in signal processing, are then 
integrated .The Hadamard transforms are applied during the encryption process, 
where the image is split into two parts and encrypted simultaneously using different 
cryptographic algorithms, including RC6.  
• Multithreading techniques are employed to optimize the encryption process.  
• Additionally, LSB steganography conceals key information within the image, 
providing an additional layer of security.  
This comprehensive methodology ensures robust security, data integrity, and confidentiality 
of image data in the cloud-based storage system, combining the strengths of distributed 
attribute-based encryption, Hadamard transforms, cryptographic algorithms, and 
steganography to create a resilient security framework.
